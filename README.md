# Personal Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my personal portfolio — rebuilt from the ground up with a stronger focus on design, performance, and long-term scalability.

The interface is powered by a **modular, widget-based system** that’s easy to extend, responsive by default, and adaptable as the project evolves. It strikes a balance between minimalism and personality, creating a solid foundation for future features without adding unnecessary complexity.

# Features

- **Light & Dark Mode** – Instantly switch themes with smooth, polished transitions.
- **Interactive Animations** – Each widget features its own subtle, purposeful motion.
- **Performance-Focused** – Fast load times and GPU-accelerated animations.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
