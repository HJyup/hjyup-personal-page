# Personal Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my personal portfolio, rebuilt with a strong focus on design and modularity.

The UI is centered around a flexible, widget-based system — easy to extend, responsive by default, and designed to grow with the project. It lays the foundation for future features while keeping things lightweight and minimal.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode** – Seamless theme switching with smooth transitions.
- **Widget Editing** – Add, remove, and reorder widgets (desktop only).
- **Widget Animations** – Each widget comes with its own subtle, unique animation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
