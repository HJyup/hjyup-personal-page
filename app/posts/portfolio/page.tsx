            I originally planned to redesign my portfolio once a year, but in my
            first year of university, I iterated on it twice. One version
            experimented with a highly interactive book, but the complexity
            overshadowed the actual content. Another version went in the
            opposite direction â€” overly minimal.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            I also tried a more "playful" concept, but it felt like I was
            chasing a cool design rather than creating something that
            represented me and my skills.

          <Text>
            These iterations taught me a simple truth: great design balances
            clarity with character. This version is built on that principle. A
            flexible, purposeful framework that feels like me.

            While working on my laptop, I noticed how elegantly widgets present
            information. They're modular, compact, and expressive, which sparked
            the idea: what if my entire portfolio felt like a widget layout?

            This approach became the perfect way to showcase projects and
            glimpses of my life. Concise and interactive.

            I began by recreating widgets from scratch, starting with the music
            widget. I liked how each widget had its own style and autonomy,
            independent of the interface.

            After feedback, I unified the background color to bring visual
            cohesion and reduce visual noise while letting personality shine
            through content and microinteractions.

            The two-column layout, with ample white space, makes the main page
            more balanced and easy to scan. I prioritised key widgets at the
            top, arranging supporting content beneath.

            and from my friend{' '}

            which emphasise minimal yet visually engaging layouts.

            I built this project with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. A flexible stack

            features.

            For interactivity, I used Framer Motion, a powerful library for
            smooth animations. Its layout transitions are unmatched. For anyone
            interested in how it works under the hood, I recommend{' '}
