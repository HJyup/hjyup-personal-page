            I originally planned to redesign my portfolio once a year. But in my
            first year of university, I did it twice. One version was an
            over-engineered interactive book; the other was so minimal it lacked
            identity. Neither felt right.

          <Text>
            Before this concept, I explored a "playful" portfolio but it didn't
            feel like me.

        <div className="mt-6 space-y-8">
          <Text>
            While working on my laptop, I just paid close attention to how
            widgets present information.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            They are modular, compact, and expressive. That sparked the idea:
            what if my entire portfolio worked like a widget layout? Perfect for
            showcasing projects and other pieces of my life.

          <Text>
            I wanted this page to blend my experience as a developer with my
            actual life - what music I love, what photos I take (because I
            really enjoy photography), and of course, the projects I build. I
            think I found a solid balance between personal and professional, and
            I'm genuinely proud of how it turned out.

            The widget system also allows for dynamic interactionsâ€”you can
            actually edit and rearrange them in real-time.

          <Text>
            I'm actively building new widgets and refining their interactivity.
            As more features are added, I'm also exploring better UX patterns to
            make everything feel intuitive and engaging. It's a fun process.
